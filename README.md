## Development Testing

Ideally, you'd write tests and put them in our `test/` directory.

If you just want to mess around with some things, we've bundled a REPL for
you which has some fixture data and exposes the core functionality of the
processing of events. To boot up the reply, launch `script/console`.

* Sample payloads are available via the variable `eventPayloads`. It
  contains a key for each event type, e.g. `pull_request` or `page_build`.
* Each processing function is available via `actions`. This object contains
  a key for each event type, e.g. `pull_request` or `page_build`. It takes
  the payload object and the callback function as its parameters, in that
  order.
